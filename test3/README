Tests and utilities for oxDNA3 implementation and porting.

A. The sequence of test is as follows:

(1) fene_basestep: single base step, two nucleotides.
(2) fene_bench: 5 bp duplex (ACGTA) at low temperature
(3) excv_bench: compressed 5 bp duplex (ACGTA) that triggers excv interaction at the first iteration step
(4) stk_bench: 5 bp duplex (ACGTA)
(5) hbond_bench: 5 bp duplex (ACGTA)
(6) dh_bench: 5 bp duplex (ACGTA) with half charged ends disabled
(7) xstk_bench: 5bp duplex (ACGTA)

B. The script 'extractPotentialParameters.py' creates the LAMMPS oxDNA3 potential file 
by mainly reading out parameters from oxDNA3_sequence_dependent_parameters.txt and
setting a few others.
