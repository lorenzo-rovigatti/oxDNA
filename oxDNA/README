oxDNA README
------------

oxDNA is a simulation code that was initially conceived as an implementation of the coarse-grained DNA
model introduced by T. E. Ouldridge, J. P. K. Doye and A. A. Louis (http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3552946).
It has been since reworked and it is now an extensible simulation+analysis framework.
It natively supports DNA, RNA, Lennard-Jones and patchy particle simulations on both CPU and NVIDIA
GPUs.
The development of this software has been partially supported by the European Commission through the Marie 
Skłodowska−Curie Fellowship No. 702298-DELTAS.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Without CUDA support:
cmake >= 2.6
make
gcc >= 4.2 / icc >= 11.0

With CUDA support:
cmake >= 2.8
make
gcc >= 4.2 / icc >= 11.0
CUDA toolkit >= 4.0

Generating the documentation (with 'make docs', see below) requires doxygen. 

COMPILING oxDNA
---------------

Extract the oxDNA archive and then:

cd oxDNA 		# enter the oxDNA folder
mkdir build 	# create a new build folder. It is good practice to compile out-of-source
cd build
cmake ..		# here you can specify additional options, see next section
make -j4		# compile oxDNA. The -jX make option makes it compile the code in parallel by using X threads.

At the end of the compilation three executables (oxDNA, DNAnalysis and confGenerator) will be placed
in the build/bin folder.

CMAKE OPTIONS
-------------

-DCUDA=ON		Enables CUDA support
-DDebug=ON		Compiles with debug symbols and without optimisation flags
-DG=ON			Compiles with debug symbols + optimisation flags
-DINTEL=ON		Uses INTEL's compiler suite
-DMPI=ON		Compiles oxDNA with MPI support

USAGE
-----

oxDNA input_file

OUTPUT FILE
-----------

The energy.dat (default name, can be changed in the configuration file) has this layout for MD:
time potential_energy kinetic_energy total_energy

The energy.dat (default name, can be changed in the configuration file) has this layout for MC:
time potential_energy hydrogen_bonding_energy acc_trasl acc_rot [acc_volume]

Mind that potential, kinetic and total energies are divided by the number of particles.

Configurations are saved in the trajectory file (appended one after the other).

OBSERVABLES
-----------

The observable infrastructure was devised to help building
customized output from oxDNA (and DNAAnalysis) without having to
dive in the simulation code itself. 

The relevant keys in the input file are analysis_data_output_* and
data_output_* (see below). These take as an argument, between curly
brackets, a series of lines that is interpreted as an input file.
An example is:

data_output_1 = {
name = caca.dat
print_every = 100
col_1 = {
type = potential_energy
}
col_2 = {
type = step
units = MD
}
}

this will print in caca.dat two colums, the first with the
potential energy and the second with the steps in MD units (dt
aware). 

The lines in between curly brackets are interpreted as input files
by the single observables.

See also the doxygen documentation for Observables/ObservableOutput.h

oxDNA provides a plugin infrastructure to manage additional 
Observables. See the doxygen documentation for PluginManagement/PluginManager.h

INPUT FILE OPTIONS
------------------

As always in UNIX environments, everything is case sensitive.
The options are in the form key = value. Key-value pairs should be either on different
lines or separated by a semicolon. There can be arbitrary spaces before and after both key and value. 
Line with a leading # will be treated as comments. The expected type of the value is specified between < and >. 
A <bool> key can be specified with values 1|0, yes|no or true|false.  
The | symbol (pipe) is used to indicate the different values that can be used to specify a value for the key.
Keys between [ and ] are optional.

Core options:

    T = <float>
        temperature of the simulation. It can be expressed in simulation units
        or kelvin (append a k or K after the value) or celsius (append a c or
        C after the value).

        the configuration file, true means that the step counter will start
        from 0/if True oxDNA will reset the step counter to 0, otherwise it
        will start from the step counter found in the initial configuration.
        Defaults to False.
    [external_forces = <bool>]
        specifies whether there are external forces acting on the nucleotides

        forces' configuration has to be provided (see external_forces_file)
    [external_forces_file = <path>]
        specifies the file containing all the external forces' configurations.

    [ffs_generate_flux = <bool>]
        CUDA FFS only. Default: False; if False, the simulation will run until
        a stopping condition is reached; if True, a flux generation simulation
        will be run, in which case reaching a condition will cause a
        configuration to be saved but will not terminate the simulation. In
        the stopping condition file, the conditions must be labelled forward1,
        forward2, ... (for the forward conditions); and backward1, backward2,
        ... (for the backward conditions), ... instead of condition1,
        condition2, ... . To get standard flux generation, set the forward and
        backward conditions to correspond to crossing the same interface (and
        use conditions corresponding to different interfaces for Tom's flux
        generation). As with the single shooting run mode, the name of the
        condition crossed will be printed to stderr each time.
    [gen_flux_save_every = <integer>]
        CUDA FFS only. Mandatory if ffs_generate_flux is True; save a
        configuration for 1 in every N forward crossings
    [gen_flux_total_crossings = <integer>]
        CUDA FFS only. Mandatory if ffs_generate_flux is True; stop the
        simulation after N crossings achieved
    [gen_flux_conf_prefix = <string>]
        CUDA FFS only. Mandatory if ffs_generate_flux is True; the prefix used
        for the file names of configurations corresponding to the saved
        forward crossings. Counting starts at zero so the 3rd crossing
        configuration will be saved as MY_PREFIX_N2.dat

    [check_initial_state = <bool>]
        CUDA FFS only. Default: False; in a flux generation simulation, set to
        true to turn on initial state checking. In this mode an initial
        configuration that crosses the forward conditions after only 1 step
        will cause the code to complain and exit. Useful for checking that a
        flux generation simulation does not start out of the A-state
    [die_on_unexpected_master = <bool>]
        CUDA FFS only. Default: False; in a flux generation simulation that
        uses master conditions, set to true to cause the simulation to die if
        any master conditions except master_forward1 or master_backward1 are
        reached. Useful for checking that a flux generation simulation does
        not enter any unwanted free energy basins (i.e. other than the initial
        state and the desired final state)
    [unexpected_master_prefix = <string>]
        CUDA FFS only. Mandatory if die_on_unexpected_master is True; the
        prefix used for the file names of configurations corresponding to
        reaching any unexpected master conditions (see
        die_on_unexpected_master).

        or it is given a negative number, a suitable device will be
        automatically chosen.
    [CUDA_sort_every = <int>]
        sort particles according to a 3D Hilbert curve every CUDA_sort_every
        time steps. This will greatly enhnance performances for some types of
        interaction. Defaults to 0, which disables sorting.

Forward Flux Sampling (FFS) options:

    backend = CPU/CUDA
        For CPU FFS/For CUDA FFS -- NB unlike the CPU implementation, the CUDA
        implementation does not print extra columns with the current order
        parameter values whenever the energy is printed
    backend_precision = <any>/mixed
        CPU FFS may use any precision allowed for a normal CPU MD
        simulation/CUDA FFS is currently only implemented for mixed precision

        This must be set for an FFS simulation
    order_parameters_file = <string>
        path to the order parameters file
    ffs_file = <string>
        path to the file with the simulation stopping conditions. Optionally,
        one may use 'master conditions' (CUDA FFS only), which allow one to

        EXAMPLES/CUDA_FFS/README file for more information
    [ffs_generate_flux = <bool>]
        CUDA FFS only. Default: False; if False, the simulation will run until
        a stopping condition is reached; if True, a flux generation simulation
        will be run, in which case reaching a condition will cause a
        configuration to be saved but will not terminate the simulation. In
