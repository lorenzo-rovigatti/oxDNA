## Input file options

In the list below the expected type of the value is specified between < and >. A <bool> key can be specified with values 1|0, yes|no or true|false. The | symbol (pipe) is used to indicate the different values that can be used to specify a value for the key. Keys between [ and ] are optional.

Core options:

    T = <float>
        temperature of the simulation. It can be expressed in simulation units
        or kelvin (append a k or K after the value) or celsius (append a c or
        C after the value).

        via periodic boundary conditions. Defaults to true.

        the initial configuration, defaults to 0
    restart_step_counter = <boolean>/<bool>

        the configuration file, true means that the step counter will start
        from 0/if True oxDNA will reset the step counter to 0, otherwise it
        will start from the step counter found in the initial configuration.
        Defaults to False.
    [external_forces = <bool>]
        specifies whether there are external forces acting on the nucleotides
        or not. If it is set to 1, then a file which specifies the external
        forces' configuration has to be provided (see external_forces_file)
    [external_forces_file = <path>]
        specifies the file containing all the external forces' configurations.

        logarithmically-spaced configurations.
    print_conf_interval = <int>
        if the time scale is linear, this is the number of time steps between
        the outputing of configurations, otherwise this is just the first
        point of the logarithmic part of the log_lin time scale
    print_conf_ppc = <int>

    backend_precision = mixed
        CUDA FFS is currently only implemented for mixed precision

    [last_particle_index = <int>]
        defaults to the index of the first-but last bead in the same strand as
        the first particle. Therefore, if I have a strand of N beads, the last

        atypical in the TEP model (e.g. it's aligned with the vector before it
        rather than the one in front of it.). index of the last particle to
        consider. All the particles coming before this one will be ignored.
    [neighbours_to_ignore = <int>]
        defalts to 1. Number of neighbours to ignore before-after each

    [only_outermost_contacts = <bool>]
        defaults to false. if true, contacts nested within other contacts will
        not be reported. E.g. if the i-th monomer is linked to both the i-1-th
        and the i+1-th monomer, and the contacts are 10-40, 10-25, 13-32,
        12-48 and 45-60, only 10-40, 12-48 and 45-60 will be reported, since
        10-25 and 13-32 are both nested inside 10-40. This is only get one
        result per plectoneme. Whatch out though, since this will report
        clashes between a plectoneme and the chain/other plectonemes. Telling
        a plectoneme and a plectoneme contact just by using the contact map
        might be non-banal.

        the plane normal.

    [generate_inside = <bool>]
        If true the wall-particle interaction may not diverge, even for

        expanded in a list of all the particles on a same strand comprised

Forward Flux Sampling (FFS) options:

    backend = CPU/CUDA
        For CPU FFS/For CUDA FFS -- NB unlike the CPU implementation, the CUDA
        implementation does not print extra columns with the current order
        parameter values whenever the energy is printed
    backend_precision = <any>/mixed
        CPU FFS may use any precision allowed for a normal CPU MD
        simulation/CUDA FFS is currently only implemented for mixed precision
    sim_type = FFS_MD
        This must be set for an FFS simulation
    order_parameters_file = <string>
        path to the order parameters file
    ffs_file = <string>
        path to the file with the simulation stopping conditions. Optionally,
        one may use 'master conditions' (CUDA FFS only), which allow one to
        more easily handle very high dimensional order parameters. See the
        EXAMPLES/CUDA_FFS/README file for more information
    [ffs_generate_flux = <bool>]
        CUDA FFS only. Default: False; if False, the simulation will run until
        a stopping condition is reached; if True, a flux generation simulation
        will be run, in which case reaching a condition will cause a
        configuration to be saved but will not terminate the simulation. In
        the stopping condition file, the conditions must be labelled forward1,
        forward2, ... (for the forward conditions); and backward1, backward2,
        ... (for the backward conditions), ... instead of condition1,
        condition2, ... . To get standard flux generation, set the forward and
        backward conditions to correspond to crossing the same interface (and
        use conditions corresponding to different interfaces for Tom's flux
        generation). As with the single shooting run mode, the name of the
        condition crossed will be printed to stderr each time.
    [gen_flux_save_every = <integer>]
        CUDA FFS only. Mandatory if ffs_generate_flux is True; save a
        configuration for 1 in every N forward crossings
    [gen_flux_total_crossings = <integer>]
        CUDA FFS only. Mandatory if ffs_generate_flux is True; stop the
        simulation after N crossings achieved
    [gen_flux_conf_prefix = <string>]
        CUDA FFS only. Mandatory if ffs_generate_flux is True; the prefix used
        for the file names of configurations corresponding to the saved
        forward crossings. Counting starts at zero so the 3rd crossing
        configuration will be saved as MY_PREFIX_N2.dat
    [gen_flux_debug = <bool>]
        CUDA FFS only. Default: False; In a flux generation simulation, set to
        true to save backward-crossing configurations for debugging
    [check_initial_state = <bool>]
        CUDA FFS only. Default: False; in a flux generation simulation, set to
        true to turn on initial state checking. In this mode an initial
        configuration that crosses the forward conditions after only 1 step
        will cause the code to complain and exit. Useful for checking that a
        flux generation simulation does not start out of the A-state
    [die_on_unexpected_master = <bool>]
        CUDA FFS only. Default: False; in a flux generation simulation that
        uses master conditions, set to true to cause the simulation to die if
        any master conditions except master_forward1 or master_backward1 are
        reached. Useful for checking that a flux generation simulation does
        not enter any unwanted free energy basins (i.e. other than the initial
        state and the desired final state)
    [unexpected_master_prefix = <string>]
        CUDA FFS only. Mandatory if die_on_unexpected_master is True; the
        prefix used for the file names of configurations corresponding to
        reaching any unexpected master conditions (see
        die_on_unexpected_master).
