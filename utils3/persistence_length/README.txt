Please use python2. Else brackets for printing will have to be added for usage in py3

Step 1 : python2 triad3.py {Usage python triad.py traj_file num_of_nucleotides alpha} Comments have been included to explain the steps.
Step 2 : python2 persistence.py {Uses files generated from triad3.py. It needs Omega3.npy not Omegas . Usage python persistence.py Omega3.npy_file e3.npy_file m rise/bp(produced by triad.py) }
Step 3 : python2 elastic_moduli.py { Uses files generated from triad3.py. Usage python elastic_moduli.py Omegas.npy rise/bp m}
