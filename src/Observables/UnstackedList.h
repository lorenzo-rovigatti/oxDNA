/**
 * @brief Prints a list of pairs involved in all order parameters that are hydrogen-bonded
 * if an order parameter file with particle pairs is provided, only those particle pairs
 * will be considered, otherwise all pairs in the system are considered.
 * @brief Prints the indices of all the particles that are NOT stacked with the particles with 
 * the following index. For example, if particle 1 is not stacked with 2, 2 is stacked with 3, 
 * 3 is not stacked with 4, it will print 1, 3.
 *
 * Based on the HBList observable, that has a better selection of which particles are to be
 * considered (can even read from order parameter files).
 * 
 * To use this observable, use type = unstacked_list
 * threshold_fraction = <double> the nucleotides will be counted as stacked if their
 *                      stacking energy is at least this fraction of the maximum stacking energy
