This example describes how to generate an initial configuration with two
strands that with sequences such that a short one (15 bases) will bind to both
ends of a longer one (40 bases) forming a seemingly circular structure.

First of all, let's generate an initial configuration:

../../utils/generate-sa.py 40. sequences

A good guess for a viable box size is the size of the longest strand, and thus
we use 40. The file `sequences' is present in this directory. The previous
command generates an initial configuration and topology, `generated.dat' and
`generated.top' respectively.

We could in principle at this stage just set up a simulation at a temperature
where we expect the bound complex to be stable, but as high as possible to
minimize unwanted secondary structure. The melting temperature of an average
15-mer at this concentration is 65C, and the yield is ~1 below 50 C. Since this
is not exactly a duplex system, we expect the melting temperature to be a
little lower because it involves bringing together two far ends of a longish
strand which is entropically costly. My pick would thus be 45C.

But we are impatient, and eaget to study the formed structure without waiting
hours to days until the assembly happens spontaneously. We give the system a
hand by putting two traps that bring together one base pair per each section.
Taking a look at the sequences

TCCCAGACATCCTCTTCGGAGCACTGTAAAATCATAGAAC
GTCTGGGAGTTCTAT

if we invert the direction of the second sequence we have
3'-TCCCAGACATCCTCTTCGGAGCACTGTAAAATCATAGAAC-5'
5'-TATCTTGAGGGTCTG-3'

and aligning them we obtain
       3'-TCCCAGACATCCTCTTCGGAGCACTGTAAAATCATAGAAC-5'
5'-TATCTTGAGGGTCTG-3'

we want to push nucleotide 47 (8th of second strand) on strand 1 and nucleotide
0 (first of first strand) together, as well as nucleotides 39 (last of first
strand) ad 48 (9th of second strand). In principle, any base pair will help,
but we picked these two because they are the ones that are less likely to
create topological/geometric traps.

So we create an external forces file with mutual traps file as follows and call
it ext.dat (there is already one in the directory):

####################

{
type=mutual_trap
r0 = 1.2
stiff = 0.5
particle = 0
ref_particle = 47
PBC=0
}

{
type=mutual_trap
r0 = 1.2
stiff = 0.5
particle = 47
ref_particle = 0 
PBC=0
}

{
type=mutual_trap
r0 = 1.2
stiff = 0.5
particle = 39
ref_particle = 48
PBC=0
}

{
type=mutual_trap
r0 = 1.2
stiff = 0.5
particle = 48
ref_particle = 39
PBC=0
}
######################

Than we start a VMMC simulation and wait for the assembly. An input file is
ready in the directory

../../build/bin/oxDNA input 

should be done in a few minutes! The 1e6 steps in the input file should be
enough to fully form the needed base pairs.
