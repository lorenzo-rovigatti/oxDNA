One of the features of the model implemented in oxDNA is that it has a
three-dimensional structure, so that it automatically incorporates
topological effects (see Flavio's paper). In this example we will see how
to initialise a single strand in with a sequence designed to form a
pseudoknot in its final configuration.

The simplest option is to just generate a single strand with the right
sequence, let it run at low temperature and wait for it to form the
pseudoknot.  Unfortunately, this can be very slow, as the formation of the
pseudoknot requires two rare events (the closure of two hairpins). One
should keep in mind that lowering the temperature to drive the formation of
the pseuoknot can backfire, since the life of metastable states becomes
longer and longer.  Nevertheless, this is a perfectly acceptable solution.

A second option is to design a specific sequence, where we use "arbitrary"
bases that only bind to one specific other base. This allows to eliminate
metastable states in the pseudoknot formation, so that one can safely lower
the temperature at will (keeping in mind that the model is physically
meaningful only at temperatures where water is liquid).

A third option is to drive the formation of the pseudoknot with artificial
forces, as one in the [hairpin formation] example. This is probably the
most time-effective solution but requires a bit more work.

We study the following sequence that forms, at low enough temperature,
drives the formation of a pesudoknot with two 6-base pair stems and two
8-base loops:

<tt>GTGCCGAAAAAAAACGCGAGACGGCACAAAAAAAACTCGCG</tt>

All the files needed to run this example are in the
<tt>${oxDNA}/EXAMPLES/PSEUDOKNOT</tt> directory. The following assumes you
work in that directory.

== Option 1==
You can run this example directly in the <tt>OPT1/</tt> directory.

First, we use the configuration generator to generate an input
configuration for a single strand. The box size does not matter as long as
it is big enough to contain the structure, so 30 s.u. will do. The file
<tt>pkseq.txt</tt> contains the above sequence. So, run

<code>../../utils/generate-sa.py 30. pkseq.txt</code>

which generates <tt>generated.dat</tt> and <tt>generated.top</tt>.

Now, we choose to run a Brownian dynamics simulation since it is much more
efficient than Monte Carlo (in our implementation) in exploring phase
space. We use the standard "aggressive" values for the thermostat (see
[Thermostat]). We use the average model in this example.  We set a fairly
low temperature, let's say 20 Celsius, significantly below the melting
temperature of the two hairpins in the average-base representation.  A long
simulation might be needed, so we start with 10^9 total steps.

We can thus run

<code>../../Release/oxDNA inputMD1</code>

and wait (possibly a long time) until the pseudoknot forms. It is not
guaranteed that the structure will for within the quite long simulation. To
detect its formation, we can run the <tt>structure analyser</tt> to detect
the formation of the correct bonds. Also, in the 5th column in the energy
file (extensive base-pairing contribution to the total energy) you expect a
number close to -8 for the formed structure (-0.7 times 12 base pairs). A
single hairpin will have around half of that.


== Option 2 ==
You can run this example directly in the <tt>OPT2/</tt> directory.

In this case, we have to repeat the all the steps above except that we need
to manually tweak the topology file to have specific binding of the bases.

So, again generate the initial configuration with <tt>generate-sa.py</tt>
and copy the topology file to a new one. The example directory already
contains a working specific topology file for the impatient.

<code>cp generated.dat specific.dat</code>.

As discussed in the [Topology file] page, specific bases can be set up with
two-digit numbers in the second column of the topology file, and
complementarity is implemented if the sum is equal to 3 (negative numbers
can be used). So if we want
base number 0 and 26 to be bound, we can set their "type" (second column)
to be 100 and -97, respectively. Pay close attention when modifying by hand
the topology file, since it is very easy to make mistakes (base types don't add
up to 3, using the wrong number, etc.). It makes sense to automatise this
task.

In this case, we want bases 0-5 to be bound to bases 26-21 and bases 14-19
to be bound to bases 41-36. Modify the topology file so that complementary
pairs have types corresponding to numbers with magnitude grater than 10 and
that add up to 3. The poly-A sections in the loop can be left as
<tt>A</tt>'s in the topology file.

If you look into the file <tt>inputMD2</tt>, you will see that it is the
same as <tt>inputMD1</tt> except that it uses <tt>specific.top</tt> as the
topology file. If you decide to use the ready specific topology file, just
copy it to <tt>specific.top</tt>. The temperature has also been lowered to
0C, since we expect no unwanted metastable states.

You can now run the code and see what happens. It should make base-pairs
more rarely, but it should make only correct ones.

<code>../../Release/oxDNA inputMD2</code>


==Option 3==
Why wait if we just want to form a structure and are not interested in how
it forms? The mutual_trap force is implemented exactly to form initial
configurations, having no physical meaning. But getting an initial
configuration is sometimes half of the job.

In this case we can use either of the topology file described above. We
choose to use Monte Carlo, though, so that we don't have to worry about
tweaking the magnitude of the traps and the thermostat parameters not to
make the system explode.

First of all, we have to generate a file where we specify the external
forces. We set up 4 traps, a mutual trap between particles 0 and 26 and a
mutual trap between particles 14 and 39. These should be enough to drive
the formation of the two stems in a relatively short time.

So, for each of the pairs, we set up a trap like this in
<tt>external.conf</tt>:

<code>
{
type = mutual_trap
particle = 0
ref_particle = 26
stiff = 1.
r0 = 1.5
}

{
type = mutual_trap
particle = 0
ref_particle = 26
stiff = 1.
r0 = 1.5
}
</code>

Repeat the same block with the indexes 0 and 26 changed to 14 and 39. 

The file <tt>inputMC</tt> is a Monte Carlo input file with everything set
up to use the <tt>external.conf</tt> file you just created.

Running the program

<code>../../Release/oxDNA inputMC</code>

should produce a pseudoknot within half an hour, maybe faster. In this case
we don't need the temperature to drive the formation of the motif, so we
can use room temperature.

Here is a picture of the formed pseudoknot: [XXX link]
